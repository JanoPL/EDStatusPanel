# edpanel
 A status monitor for Elite Dangerous, written in PHP. Designed for 1080p screens. Fork or download to adjust and/or improve as needed or wanted.

## IMPORTANT
Make sure that the path stated in inc.php is accessible by the web server you are putting these files on. Otherwise the monitor won't work.

The file panel.php is the main file to open the status monitor.

Put the browser that displays the panel to full screen mode so that everything aligns perfectly on a 1080p screen.
